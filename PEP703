PEP 703 removes the GIL, enabling true parallel Python execution. In agentic AI pipelines, most CPU-bound workloads, including multi-agent reasoning loops, batch data transformations, and planning over independent branches, can benefit from multi-core threading. Traversing and updating mutable trees, such as planning trees, Monte Carlo Tree Search structures, or hierarchical decision graphs, is the only common CPU-bound case that cannot be parallelized, because node updates depend on one another and must execute sequentially.
