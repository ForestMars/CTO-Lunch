    ### Factors that Affect Cost:
    
    1. **GPU Type**: A100s are more expensive, but also more powerful for distributed deep learning tasks. T4 and V100 GPUs are cheaper and might still be sufficient for certain tasks.
    2. **Instance Type**: If you're using a specialized instance (e.g., P4d on AWS or A100s), costs will rise.
    3. **Spot Instances/Preemptible VMs**: These offer significant discounts (up to 90%), but they can be interrupted, so not ideal for long-running jobs.
    4. **Storage and Data Transfer**: Costs can add up if you're working with large datasets that require high storage and frequent data transfers.
    
    ### Free/Lower-Cost Options (For Learning and Small Projects):
    
    - **Google Colab**: Free access to Tesla K80, P100, and T4 GPUs (limited session duration and restrictions on usage).
    - **Kaggle Kernels**: Offers free access to T4 GPUs with limited hours.
    - **Paperspace Community**: Offers a lower-cost option for learning with limited resources.
    - **Azure Notebooks**: Free but with restrictions on computational resources.
    
    If you're looking for long-term, large-scale distributed training, cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure would be your go-to. However, if you're more into experimentation or short-term practice, using something like Paperspace, Lambda, or even preemptible instances on GCP or AWS can save costs significantly.
