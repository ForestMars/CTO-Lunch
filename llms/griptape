- Griptape is different from LangChain in the following ways:
    
    Instead of chained agents, it uses more general-purpose DAGs and pipelines. Think of it as Airflow for LLMs. It still implements chain of thought logic for prompt workflow steps that use tools but it also supports any kind of input and output (think images, audio, etc.). - Griptape tools are designed to be decoupled from the caller logic and execution environments. For example, tools can be easily run in a Docker container or a Lambda function (as opposed to just YOLOing LLM-generated Python code on the local box). - Tools can be plugged into other LLM frameworks through adapters. For example, you can convert any Griptape tool into a LangChain tool or generate a ChatGPT Plugin API with a single line of code. This is the only place Griptape actually references LangChain in code, afaik :)
