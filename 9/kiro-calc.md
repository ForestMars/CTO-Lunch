    - coming soon pricing → There were three plans, with free offering 50 interactions per month, Pro at $19.00 per user/month with 1,000 interactions, and Pro+ at $39.00 with 3,000 interactions. Additional interactions were to be $0.04 each.

    - pdate delivered improved prompt caching and better error messages, informing developers when they had hit the new daily limit, to the irritation of some. "I didn't have these limits the 1st 4 days of my project … now I am restricted," said one, frustrated that there is no option to pay for more AI tokens.
    - Kiro has “spec mode”
    - The revised pricing has a free tier with 50 vibe requests (yes, no spec requests at all); Pro at $20 with 225 vibe and 125 spec; Pro+ with 450 vibe and 250 spec; and Power at $200 with 2,250 vibe and 1,250 spec. Additional vibe requests are $0.04 each, while spec requests cost five times more, $0.20 each.
