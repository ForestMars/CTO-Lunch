### GPT-5 Dyson Bubble

- GPT5 (Dyson Bubble)
    
    kneecapped “plus”
    
    router disaster 
    
    “hyped like [it was] the second coming of Ultron” they were promised fireworks and got a desk lamp
    
    OpenAI [claimed](https://x.com/deedydas/status/1953853659848016138) 74.9% on SWE-Bench just to prove they were above Opus 4.1’s 74.5%…
    
    By running it on 477 problems instead of the full 500.
    
    - UPDATE: they are doubling the limit for GPT-5 Thinking and bringing back GPT-4o
    
    [There's a strong case that GPT-5 could shift a large share of the $1.4B code-assistant spend from Anthropic to OpenAI during the next contract cycle.](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1953937572687647171)
    
    OpenAI, like Apple, is now a consumer product company, so they have transitioned to proritizing normies over techies.
    
    Better but doesn’t feel like next scale in model size and certainly didn’t live up to the manhattan project / death star hype. As one CTO commented, “more like the size of his ego” 
    
    - “trust us, it’ll be cool”
        
        reliance on *belief in the mission* over *clear monetization strategy*
        
        massive cash burn, unclear fundamentals
        
        personality cult 
        
        nine minutes of mutual backslapping won’t hide the lack of vision.

    stargate norway
    
    not quite a faceplant debacle
    
    those of us old enough to remember their rumor that they couldn't do the 2023.release on time because it was too dangerous and they feared it would take over the world?)
    
    - Only GPT5 avail in Pro with no warning (and no user research)
    - Cursos execs appearing on Livestream making GPT default over Claude’’
    - Altman said GPT-5’s [launch was botched](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/sam-altman-openai-chatgpt5-launch-data-centers-investments/) after backlash over the model’s colder persona forced OpenAI to reinstate GPT-4o for users.
    - predicted OpenAI will need to spend trillions on data centers to scale ChatGPT.

 (OpenAI also muses publically about buying chrome, putting data centers on the moon and likens covering the Earth with data centers to dyson sphere around the entire solar system (no, we’re not making that up) showing an incredible confusion between of Type I and Type II civilizations on the Kardashev scale.
