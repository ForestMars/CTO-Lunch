### Industry Impact

Translate the show floor into procurement and roadmap realities.

- **Red-team automation becomes standard.** Expect vendors to sell “AI pentest” features and for internal security teams to adopt agentic tools for continuous scanning. This reduces time-to-discover for certain classes of vulnerabilities but raises validation overhead (false positives, hallucinated exploits).
- **Privacy tooling moves up the stack.** Mixnets and browser-based user-control tooling will show up in vendor contracts and RFPs for privacy-sensitive customers (media, healthcare, legal). “No tracking” search and subscription privacy services will inch into enterprise procurement as options for corporate tooling.
- **Hardware risk accelerates attack yield.** Cheap physical exploits and supply-chain issues mean infrastructure with edge devices (kiosks, ATMs, IoT) will be targeted more often. Expect insurance claims and compliance scrutiny to follow.
- **New compliance expectations.** User-first data control tooling (export/erase) will make data portability a delivered feature, and regulators will treat it like a standard expectation rather than a novelty.
- **Talent market changes.** HOPE continues to be a place where practical, curious engineers are visible; companies that participate (sponsor, send folks) will find higher-signal hires for security, firmware, and infrastructure roles.
