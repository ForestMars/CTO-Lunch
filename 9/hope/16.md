The hacker community that used to live in basements and IRC channels is now building tools that matter to enterprise architecture, from agentic AI that can find exploits, to mixnet VPNs that actually ship. The vibe was the same as always — part hardware flea market, part forecasting lab — but the output felt more production-adjacent than “gee-whiz demo” this year. Send an engineer. Send a manager too. Don’t send the person who thinks MFA = SMS.

HOPE_16’s a dive into the hacker swamp, showing what’s gunning for your systems: rogue AI, pwned IoT, cloaked ransomware. Deploy zero-trust, continuous pen-testing (XBOW-style), and encrypted IoT with OTA updates. Pair analytics with encryption to spot threats hiding in “secure” channels. If security is a concern at your company you should be sending at least one engineer (to lurk, not recruit) and map fast changing attack surfaces to stay unbreached.

HOPE_16 felt like a strategic-tech-intelligence session disguised as a hacker con, full of talks on "agentic web" and how autonomous AI is creating new attack vectors, and demos exploring digital warfare on a $15 budget. Even the keynotes highlighted a shift: while the crowd was there for the latest on radical privacy (a continued theme) and how to protect themselves from government snooping (the *raison d'être* of the conference since 1994), speakers like John Kiriakou and Seth Godin were there to talk about something else entirely. The first, a former CIA officer, spoke on the ethics of state-sponsored torture and the second, a marketing guru, on "Learning to See Invisible Systems." The contrast between the two men was obvious: one sent to prison for his beliefs, the other making millions from his. But it was a key omission in Godin's talk that revealed the hard truth: he weirdly didn't connect his talk on "invisible systems" to how AI agents are building them behind our backs, closing off the epistemic horizon to outside knowledge, and making it harder for our systems (and us) to know what we don't know. The irony was palpable. The "agentic web" is building a new form of digital surveillance, as well as enabling new attack vectors most organizations have yet to start preparing for. (As one attendee put it, “the agentic web is the new dark web”)
