### Why this Matters for Your Business

Here’s what you should put on the sprint board and in the Q4 budget.

1. **Treat agentic AI as a first-class threat and tool**
    - Pilot AI-assisted red-teaming and incorporate its findings into CI. Do not accept “AI found it” as a final decision — require human validation and safety gates.
    - Add LLM-specific adversarial tests to your SRE test matrix (reasoning fuzzing, chained-prompt stress tests).
2. **Privacy-by-design is no longer optional**
    - Run an SDK/tags inventory immediately. Block or isolate anything that collects persistent identifiers or precise location data without clear business need.
    - Start at least one privacy pilot (e.g., internal mixnet VPN for high-risk teams or a no-tracking analytics stack for product telemetry).
3. **Harden the physical edge**
    - Require firmware signing, secure boot, and remote revocation for any hardware you deploy. Treat field devices as a first-class threat vector.
    - Add a physical-access scenario to incident playbooks (someone with a debug cable, someone swapping SD cards, etc.).
4. **Operationalize continuous pentesting**
    - Make continuous pentesting and config-drift scanning a mandatory pipeline stage for releases. Automate rollback criteria for dangerous changes.
    - Start contracting ethical hacker engagements specifically for IoT and physical systems.
5. **Build relationships with hacker communities**
    - Sponsor a village or send engineers who will return with actual sprint items. Pragmatic exposure beats second-hand slideware.
6. **Supply-chain contingency**
    - For any hardware project, require BOM transparency from vendors and define alternative suppliers in contracts (and test them).
