Remember when we used to take Summer off? Ah those were simpler times. These days, even Summer doesn’t let you catch your breath, with blah blah funding rounds hacker onslaughts and the first robot vehicles officially approced to hit the streets. 

Remember when we used to take summers off? Ah, those were simpler times — Europe shut down, Wall Street thinned out, and tech calendars ran on the assumption that nothing truly world-shifting would happen between July 4th and Labor Day. That world is gone. These days, August doesn’t let you catch your breath, much less step away. The pace is relentless: funding rounds stacking on top of each other, hackers hammering away at production systems like cicadas in heat, and — just in case you thought your commute was safe — the first robot cars getting state approval to roll through Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. It’s no longer “business as usual” but “business as breathlessness.”

That breathlessness isn’t an accident; it’s the operating system of the people building out this next phase of technology. Every quarter brings another milestone that would’ve once anchored an entire year’s worth of industry chatter. Case in point: NVIDIA just disclosed that a single customer accounted for 23% of their $46.7 billion in quarterly revenue — do the math, that’s $10.75 billion from one buyer over three months. Who is that whale, and how many racks of H100s (or Blackwells) does it take to stack up ten billion in a summer? The sheer concentration risk is staggering, but it also tells you how few players are really driving the market at scale.

Meanwhile, the tooling stack keeps marching forward in quieter but equally telling ways. On August 23rd, FFmpeg dropped version 8.0 with the auspicious codename “Huffman” — a wink at compression, sure, but also a reminder that we’re still building the rails on which this whole video- and AI-driven internet runs. Nothing flashy about a codec release, but in an era when GPU cycles and bandwidth costs dominate infra budgets, it’s these under-the-hood shifts that shape what’s possible at the application layer. Ignore them at your peril.

So here we are: late August, no slowdown in sight, no oxygen left in the room. The calendar used to mark summer as an intermission; now it’s just another act in the same high-frequency play. And if the past month is any indication, the curtain never really comes down.

Breathlessness is literally the modus operandi of those who are building out [this] technology. 

NVIDIA just said their sales to just one customer represented 23% of their total $46.7 billion of revenue from the quarter (who is there $10.75B over 3 months customer!)
