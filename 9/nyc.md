Waymo just got the green light to test up to eight autonomous vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. Human safety drivers must remain behind the wheel during trials which runsthrough late September and avoids actual passenger pickups. 

On the money front, NYC startups were on a tear: Profound pulled in $35M Series B to juice AI-powered search; IVIX landed $60M Series B (fraud detection for financial services, led by O.G. Venture Partners with Insight & Citi); and Columbia-founded August, an AI startup founded by Columbia alumni, raised $7M in August to automate document-heavy tasks for midsize law firms. So much low hanging fruit. Carbyne (AI-enabled 911 solutions: intelligent routing, real-time translation, dispatcher automation) topped the list with a $100M Series D led by AT&T and SVB, riding the wave of VC love for AI-enabled public safety tools (real-time translation, dispatcher automation, smart routing).

Not everyoneâ€™s thrilled about AI in public safety: City Councilman Frank Morano floated a bill to require AI chatbot licensing for any provider operating in NYC (from OpenAI and Google down to the scrappiest local startups.) And for those of you who take your safety *very* seriously, the HOPE conference returned to Queens for its first annual iteration in since 1994. with its trademark mix of badge exploits, solder fumes, and eye-opening lessons for anyone running production systems.
