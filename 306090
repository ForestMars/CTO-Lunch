**30: Triage & Foundational Interception**

- **AI API Gateway Mandate:** all new LLM integrations (whether OpenAI, Anthropic, or open-source) must pass through a mandatory, internal Interception Layer.
    - Leverage emerging tools like **Orq.ai** or **Portkey** to implement prompt logging, cost tracking, and automatic fallback modeling (e.g., *GPT-4o* → *Claude 4.5*).
    - **Value:** Creates the **Vendor-Agnostic Layer** required for instant model arbitrage, cost-capping, and the essential data logging needed for future fine-tuning.

### **Next 60 Days: The Secure Agentic Build-Out**

- **Action:** **Operationalize the Secure Agentic Blueprint.** Design and deploy sandboxed, containerized environments for "AI Operators" to perform *auditable actions* against internal systems (CRMs, ERPs, Databases).
- **Detail:** Integrate this sandbox with robust observability and evaluation tools (**Braintrust, Langfuse**) to test for core security failure modes: **Prompt Injection** and **Data Poisoning** attacks, which are now critical security vectors (Result 1.1, 1.2).
- **Value:** Establishes the auditable infrastructure required for **Secure Automation.** This is the bedrock for the productivity leap that comes from multi-step, complex AI workflows, mitigating the "Chat-as-OS" risk.

### **Next 90 Days (EOY): The Strategic Data Pivot**

- **Action:** **Define and Fund the "Proprietary Data Advantage" Roadmap for 2026.** Identify the 3–5 highest-value workflows where fine-tuning an open-source model provides an unassailable competitive advantage.
    - **Detail:** Begin preparation of high-quality, task-specific proprietary data sets (vector embeddings, RAG data) for targeted models like **Gemma 2.0** or **Mistral’s next-gen base model** to create an on-prem or VPC-based expert.
    - **Value:** **Competitive Moat & FinOps.** Shifts the organization from an AI consumer to a sovereign AI architect with clear unit economics and defensible intellectual property (IP Risk, Result 1.4).
