Project Mercury: Wall Street's AI Gambit
Codenamed "Project Mercury," OpenAI is paying contractors $150/hour to write prompts and create Excel-based models for IPOs, restructurings, and M&A deals. The goal? To teach AI how to replicate—and eventually automate—the tedious modeling and deck-editing work that dominates life for junior analysts at investment banks.
This is the most strategically significant AI deployment happening right now, and almost no one is paying attention.
Here's why it matters: whoever wins the financial services AI automation market wins the entire enterprise AI market. Investment banking is the perfect target: high-value work (junior analysts cost $200K+ all-in), highly standardized (every pitch deck follows the same structure), painful enough that clients will pay for automation, and prestigious enough that success creates a halo effect for every other enterprise vertical.
The work Mercury is targeting—building comps tables, updating DCF models, reformatting slide decks to match brand guidelines—is simultaneously mind-numbing and absolutely critical. Get it wrong and the deal doesn't close. Get it right and you've just saved 60 hours of analyst time per engagement. At $200K annual cost per analyst, a bank with 1,000 analysts and 50% task automation just saved $100M annually.
But the strategic value isn't cost savings—it's talent arbitrage. Investment banks lose their best junior talent after 2-3 years because the job is 70% Excel hell and 30% actual finance. If Mercury can automate the Excel hell, banks can retain talent, redeploy them to higher-value work, and create a moat around relationship management that consulting firms can't replicate.
Who's competing for this market? Bloomberg Terminal with AI features, but they're hamstrung by terminal lock-in and a business model that incentivizes seat licenses over productivity. Palantir's Foundry platform, but their focus is defense and national security, not financial services. Google and Microsoft, but they're selling horizontal tools (Workspace AI, Copilot) rather than vertical solutions. The real competition is custom in-house builds at Goldman, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan, who see this as a core competency they can't outsource.
OpenAI's advantage is simple: they have the best reasoning models, the most comprehensive training data partnerships, and the capital to subsidize development until the product is unbeatable. If Mercury works, they'll own financial services AI for a decade. If it doesn't, they've just spent $50M learning how not to automate one of the most valuable white-collar workflows in existence. Either way, CTOs in financial services should be paying very close attention, because this is a preview of your 2026 budget conversations.
