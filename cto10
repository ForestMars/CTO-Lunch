    - Sep 10 OpenAI ([finally](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1965807401745207708)) added full support for MCP tools in ChatGPT. (Developer mode only)
        - Sorry, but this is not "MCP Support" if we are forced to have a "search" and "fetch" tool. Do you expect every single existing MCP server to spend time implementing search/fetch to make it usable?

            - crypto debt
                
                Russia accuses the U.S. of using crypto to erase its $35T debt.
                
                Putin’s adviser says Washington will “shove debt into stablecoins, devalue it, and reset the system.”
                
                here's how this works 👇
                
                Last month, President Trump signed the 𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗜𝗨𝗦 𝗔𝗰𝘁, America’s first federal crypto law:
                
                - Stablecoins must be 𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝟭:𝟭 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 + 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗵
                - Public audits + AML/KYC compliance are mandatory
                - Private companies can now issue digital dollars
                
                Why this is genius:
                
                - Every $1 of digital dollars = $1 of demand for U.S. government debt.
                - The U.S. gets 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗽 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 (more buyers for its debt) without needing to print new money.
                
                While China debates digital yuan and Europe kills innovation with MiCA compliance, the US is building 𝗮 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲:
                
                1. Stablecoin issuers must back coins 1:1 with U.S. Treasuries
                
                2. They keep 𝟭𝟬𝟬% 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘂𝗿𝘆 𝘆𝗶𝗲𝗹𝗱𝘀 (currently 4%+)
                
                3. Users get digital dollars, issuers get 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸-𝗳𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘀
                
                4. More stablecoins = more Treasury demand = cheaper U.S. borrowing costs for its dept
                
                [**Circle**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/circle-internet-financial/)
                
                𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲𝘀 ~$𝟮𝗕 𝗮 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿 just from Treasury yields backing USDC.
                
                Scale this across $100B… $1T… $10T in stablecoins?
                
                That’s a 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗲-𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗵 𝗰𝗼𝘄 that quietly funds U.S. debt while exporting digital dollars worldwide.
                
                In plain English:
                
                The U.S. just created a way to reduce its borrowing costs, extend the dollar’s dominance, and let private firms do the heavy lifting.
                
                Example:
                
                - Say Treasuries yield 4%, but inflation runs at 5%.
                - Holders of Treasuries (whether it’s Circle via USDC reserves, or foreign central banks) are effectively losing 1% of purchasing power every year.
                - The U.S. still services its debt “on time,” but in real terms, it’s paying back less.
                
                No money printing. No new taxes.
                
                But massive geopolitical leverage
                
            
            stablecoins make money from high interest rates through t-bills
            
            1. interest rates will come down. you can read dalio, watch america’s plunging economy, or just listen to the fed
            
            projects like Bittensor are already proving what permissionless AI can unlock.
            
    
    By pairing DX’s intelligence solution with Atlassian’s AI-powered SDLC tools, customers unlock a powerful flywheel for transformation: using DX data to pinpoint bottlenecks, and then addressing them with Atlassian’s tools and solutions in a targeted, data-driven way.

    - Hypermedia API → MCP
        
        turn any Hypermedia API into an MCPs using [Daniel Doubrovkine’s](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dblock_turning-hypermedia-apis-into-mcps-activity-7374821452707160064-Duam?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAFK68oBYJeabHrbPkgN8xE9WF5u-jXnhYo) new hyperclient-mcp gem.
        
        Hypermedia (think of it as C to GraphQL’s Java)  Few people can build good Hypermedia APIs but a lot of people can build GraphQL APIs that are not horrible as Wundergraph’s Jens Neuse notes)

    While AI made shipping code cheap, it’s done so at the cost of doing so securely which has increased commensurately.
