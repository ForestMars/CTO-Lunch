This month brought us the internet's greatest achievement and its most catastrophic infrastructure in the same breath. Archive.org just crossed the one trillion page mark, a feat of digital preservation so vast it's like cataloging every grain of sand on a beach nobody asked you to count. Or most likely ever be looked at by another human being again. Days later, an AWS control-plane outage took out over 3,500 companies, from fintechs to federal contractors, proving once again that our civilization now runs on a single distributed dependency graph. We've built systems capable of cataloging a trillion pages but incapable of failing gracefully when a single control plane hiccups

- Archive.org crossed one trillion pages this month humanity's entire digital memory, preserved in perpetuity. Three days later, an AWS control-plane outage took down over 3,500 companies in under an hour, from fintech startups to federal contractors. The juxtaposition isn't ironic; it's diagnostic. We've built systems capable of cataloging a trillion pages but incapable of failing gracefully when a single control plane hiccups.
