Project Mercury is OpenAI’s play for Wall Street, and it’s smarter than it looks. They’re hiring contractors at $150/hr to train AI on investment banking workflows: IPO modeling, M&A comps, deck reformatting, the grunt work that defines junior analyst life. The insight is simple: whoever wins financial services AI wins enterprise AI. Banks spend hundreds of millions annually on work that’s structurally formulaic. 50% automation = $100M annual savings for large banks, but the real prize is talent arbitrage: senior bankers freed from deck hell can do higher-value work.

OpenAI’s competition includes Bloomberg (AI Terminal), Palantir Foundry, Google, Microsoft, and in-house builds at major banks. OpenAI’s edge: best reasoning models, strong data partnerships, capital advantage. Success means dominating financial services AI for a decade. Failure teaches them what doesn’t work and costs maybe costs $50M (or 3x what they just paid for a single TLD.) 

The work Mercury is targeting building comps tables, updating DCF models, reformatting slide decks to match brand guidelines—is simultaneously mind-numbing and absolutely critical. Get it wrong and the deal doesn’t close. Get it right and you’ve just saved 60 hours of analyst time per engagement. At $200K annual cost per analyst, a bank with 1,000 analysts and 50% task automation just saved $100M annually. This is a much bigger play than the attention it’s been getting. 

Who’s competing for this market? Bloomberg Terminal with AI features, but they’re hamstrung by terminal lock-in and a business model that incentivizes seat licenses over productivity. Palantir’s Foundry platform, but their focus is defense and national security, not financial services. Google and Microsoft, but they’re selling horizontal tools (Workspace AI, Copilot) rather than vertical solutions. The real competition is custom in-house builds at Goldman, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan, who see this as a core competency they can’t outsource.

OpenAI’s advantage is simple: they have the best reasoning models, the most comprehensive training data partnerships, and the capital to subsidize development until the product is unbeatable. If Mercury works, they’ll own financial services AI for a decade. If it doesn’t, they’ve just spent $50M learning how not to automate one of the most valuable white-collar workflows in existence. Either way, CTOs in financial services should be paying very close attention, because this is a preview of your 2026 budget conversations.



But here’s where it gets interesting: while Project Mercury targets white-collar automation, OpenAI’s bigger move is ofc  ChatGPT Atlas. The browser wars are back.
