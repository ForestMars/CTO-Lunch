    Following up on September's SharePoint hack: for anyone who downplayed its criticality, **foreign hackers breached a US nuclear weapons plant via SharePoint flaws**. The CVE-2025-49596 remote code execution vulnerability that Microsoft initially described as "moderate severity" just compromised classified national security infrastructure.
    
    This isn't a "patch your systems" reminder. This is a **"your entire threat model is wrong"** alarm. The attack chain went: SharePoint vulnerability → network pivot → exfiltration of sensitive data from a facility that processes nuclear materials. The vulnerability was exploited in the wild for months before the breach was detected. Microsoft's response was to issue a patch and move on. No acknowledgment of the offshore engineering team that maintains SharePoint on-prem. No explanation of how a "moderate severity" bug became a nation-state attack vector.
    
    For CTOs, the lesson is blunt: **SaaS vendor security ratings are theater**. Microsoft has SOC 2, FedRAMP, every compliance cert you can name. They still shipped a vulnerability that compromised a nuclear facility. The next time a vendor shows you their security questionnaire, remember that compliance certifications are about covering liability, not preventing breaches.
    
    The modern threat model assumes your vendors are compromised, your supply chain is hostile, and your perimeter doesn't exist. Design accordingly.
