NVIDIA hit $4 trillion. Bitcoin peaked at $120K. Meta started offering $1 billion compensation packages to poach entire research teams. The Windsurf acquisition collapsed at OpenAI on Friday and rebuilt itself across Google and Cognition by Monday. New York absorbed $800 million in AI investment in a single month. Meanwhile, AI models are now achieving gold-medal performance on math olympiads and reasoning through problems that challenge PhD researchers, with compute requirements doubling every six months. For CTOs, this isn't noiseâ€”it's signal. The infrastructure choices you make today, the talent you secure now, and the AI capabilities you deploy over the next six months will separate the companies that ride this wave from those that get crushed by it. Your technology decisions have never mattered more.
