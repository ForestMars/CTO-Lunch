Summer's here but it should be obvious tech isn't taking a vacation. Although OpenAI did “pause operations” for a week as the AI Talent Wars heated up. If you thought last month was wild, July continued to accelerate (and New York's center stage glow only got brighter) as decade-long commitments, premium real estate, and the kind of bets that signal where real money thinks this all is heading collided with intensifying regulatory pressure and increasingly expensive talent wars. It’s as if we're watching an entirely new category of competition emerge. (And yes, it's still impossible to write about any of this without sounding like you're prompting an LLM.)

One thing this month made abundantly clear: the AI arms race in tech is moving from the lab and into the boardroom (and your budget.) We’ll try to keep this month tight but tbh, there’s a helluva lot to cover; time to lock in.

NYC: Office Leases, Legal Pressure & Robotaxis
Context and Background
New York City continues its rapid ascent as a tech hub, increasingly rivaling Silicon Valley. This month, the city cemented its position with significant state investments like the $400 million Empire AI program and a robust influx of capital into its tech ecosystem. July saw a wave of multi-million dollar funding rounds across diverse sectors, including fintech, AI, insurtech, and health startups, signaling strong investor confidence.

However, this growth is accompanied by a proactive regulatory stance. Albany introduced the RAISE Act (S.9180B/A.10287A), targeting "frontier" AI models—those trained with over $100 million in compute and capable of causing "critical harm," defined as death or serious injury to 100+ people, or over $1 billion in property/financial damage. The bill mandates detailed safety protocols, annual audits, and a 72-hour reporting window for "safety incidents." While the Governor has until December 31, 2025, to act, this legislation could set a national precedent. Mayor Eric Adams also reaffirmed his commitment to a "smarter city" through AI and blockchain, proposing digital solutions for civic services.

She Ain't Heavy, She's My SDLC*
Context and Background
The software development lifecycle is undergoing a significant transformation driven by AI. We're seeing the emergence of third-generation AI agents that move beyond simple code completion to act as orchestrators for entire development workflows. Tools like GitHub Copilot's agentic DevOps, Zencoder Zen Agents, Claude 4, and Jules can now ingest backlog items, generate feature code, run tests, and interact autonomously with CI/CD pipelines. This signals a fundamental shift towards AI-native software development, where AI becomes a central driver of the SDLC.

However, a recent Atlassian study presented a nuanced view on AI's impact on developer productivity. The randomized controlled trial found that AI coding tools actually slowed down experienced open-source developers by an average of 19%, despite these developers perceiving themselves to be 20% faster. The slowdown stemmed from the time needed to review and correct AI-suggested code. The study noted that junior engineers or those in unfamiliar codebases did experience productivity gains. This suggests that while AI makes the development experience more pleasant, its real-world productivity impact for senior developers is not as straightforward as often claimed.

Adding to the competitive landscape, Meta has reportedly switched to using Claude models for coding, and AWS launched Kiro, its own Cursor clone. The "model fiesta" continues with new major releases, including Google's latest AI model and Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1.
