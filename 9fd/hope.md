First, the big M&A news: Atlassian is acquiring Brooklyn startup **The Browser Company** for a reported $610 million in a cash only deal. Itâ€™s a *yuge* exit for a local company not to mention an obvious sign that the enterprise giants are paying top dollar for AI-powered productivity tools and the radioactive AI browser space. Not bad for a company that doesn't currently have a product (they EOL'd  Arc browser, and haven't yet released Dia, their AI-native browser.) But seriously, mega-congratulations to Josh, Brian, and the whole team! 

Other NYC startups were also on a tear this month: Profound pulled in $35M Series B to juice AI-powered search; IVIX landed $60M Series B (fraud detection for financial services, led by O.G. Venture Partners with Insight & Citi); and Columbia-founded August, an AI startup founded by Columbia alumni, raised $7M in August to automate document-heavy tasks for midsize law firms. So much low hanging fruit. Carbyne (AI-enabled 911 solutions: intelligent routing, real-time translation, dispatcher automation) topped the list with a $100M Series D led by AT&T and SVB, riding the wave of VC love for AI-enabled public safety tools (real-time translation, dispatcher automation, smart routing).

On the policy front, City Councilman Frank Morano (presumably emboldened by the still unsigned RAISE Act) floated a bill to require AI chatbot licensing for any provider operating in NYC (from OpenAI and Google down to the scrappiest local startups.) And for those of you who take your public safety **very** seriously, the HOPE conference returned to Queens for its first annual iteration since 1994. with its trademark mix of badge exploits, solder fumes, and eye-opening lessons for anyone running production systems.

Meanwhile on the streets of NYC Waymo just got the green light to test up to eight autonomous vehicles (Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn.) Human safety drivers must remain behind the wheel during trials which runs through late September and avoids actual passenger pickups.
