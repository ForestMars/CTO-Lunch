## HOPE’s Sweet Sixteen

If last month’s annual AWS Summit is where the industry gathers to solve problems on a corporate scale, this month’s newly annual HOPE conference (”Hackers on Planet Earth”) is where we go to learn what those problems actually are. At least if you’re like me and have poor impulse control and access to a corporate card. Though I didn’t happen to see a single other person who was at both events, as much as I hoped in vain to run into someone also experiencing extreme dress code whiplash. 

This 16th iteration (Aug 15–17, 2025 at St. John’s University in Queens) marked HOPE’s shift, for the first time in three decades, to an *annual* schedule, and the first time the the legendary cyber-punk conflagration for (mostly) talented security researchers who don’t have jobs in government due to their personal beliefs, has followed rather than preceded DEFCON. If you weren’t paranoid about your security perimeter before, it was basically like an extended blue team horror flick. (Although your red team is likely laughing at all the carnage.) 

### Context and Background

The hacker community that used to thrive mainly in basements and IRC channels is now building tools that matter to enterprise architecture, from agentic AI that can find exploits (for both red and blue teams) to mixnet VPNs. The vibe was same as always, part hardware flea market, part forecasting lab, but this year the output felt more production-adjacent than “gee-whiz demos.” HOPE_16 waded into the hacker swamp, showing what (if not who) is gunning for your systems: rogue AI, pwned IoT, cloaked ransomware and more. It felt like a weekend long strategic-tech-intelligence session disguised as a hacker con with talks on the "agentic web" and how autonomous AI is creating new attack vectors, as well as the return of the popular “digital warfare on a $15 budget.” Eye-opening to say the least, if you’re responsible for your company’s information security.  

With the change in venue (since 2022) comes a vibe shift: while the crowd was there for the latest on radical privacy and how to protect themselves from government snooping (the *raison d'être* of the conference since 1994), featured speakers spoke on a wider range of topics, ranging from John Kiriakou (first CIA officer to expose use of waterboarding on Al Queda terrorists) who not surprisingly spoke on the ethics of torture, to marketing guru Seth Godin who was there to talk about the ethics of jumping the shark, apparently. The contrast between the two men was obvious: one sent to prison for his beliefs, the other making millions from his. But it was a key omission in Godin's talk that was most revealing: he weirdly didn't connect his talk on "invisible systems" (reminded me of Gene Kim’s “visible ops” and Simon Wardley’s “value maps”) to how AI agents are literally building them behind our backs, closing off the epistemic horizon to outside knowledge, and making it harder for our visible systems (and us) to know what we don't know. The irony was palpable, given how the "agentic web" (which the hallway track was buzzing about) is building new form of digital surveillances and enabling new attack vectors most organizations have yet to start preparing for. (As one attendee put it, “the agentic web is the new dark web.”) 

The technical sessions drove this point home *with unsettling precision.* Traditional automated pentesting frameworks like XBOW are already chaining scanning and exploit scripts to accelerate discovery 80× faster than human red-teamers working manually. And AI-powered systems are evolving beyond simple automation; researchers demonstrated how LLMs trained on Capture the Flag challenges can now adapt their strategies in real-time, developing novel exploit chains that even seasoned security professionals hadn't anticipated. These emergent behaviors create entirely new classes of vulnerabilities that existing security frameworks can't adequately address. Meanwhile, classic attack vectors persist with alarming effectiveness: even multi-factor authentication can be bypassed through sophisticated brute-force attacks on Remote Desktop Services (so fundamental security hygiene remains table stakes) For CISOs and security architects, HOPE_16 delivered a stark message: the threat landscape is becoming genuinely alien, driven by autonomous systems that operate faster than human defenders can comprehend, let alone counter. The [dark forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_forest_hypothesis) is starting to take notice. 

### Technical Specs

- AI-pentest scale: XBOW claims 1,092 zero-day finds, “80× faster vs manual”; integrating GPT-5 yielded ~2× throughput gain.
- Ransomware volume: 3,627 incidents in H1 2025 (+47 % YoY); 506 in Aug 2025 alone. [Acronis]
- IoT risk prevalence: ~35 billion connected devices (2025 forecast); ≥50 % have ≥1 critical/high vulnerability; IoT vectors in 1 in 3 breaches.
- Patch SLA adherence: CISA demands critical fixes within 15 days; recommended triage: workaround within 72 h, full rem. in 15 days.
- Agentic IAM controls: Enforce token TTL ≤ 15 minutes for write-capable agents; agent events logged immutably, retained ≥ 12 months.
- Pentest KPI targets: MTTR for critical KEV ≤ 15 days; exfil detection TTD ≤ 24 h; false positives on “critical” automated findings < 25 %

### Industry Impact

Translate the show floor into procurement and roadmap realities.

- **Red-team automation becomes standard.** Expect vendors to sell “AI pentest” features and for internal security teams to adopt agentic tools for continuous scanning and reduce time-to-discover for certain classes of vulnerabilities (but raises validation overhead for false positives & hallucinated exploits.)
- **Privacy tooling moves up the stack.** Mixnets and browser-based user-control tooling will show up in vendor contracts and RFPs for privacy-sensitive customers (media, healthcare, legal). “No tracking” search and subscription privacy services will inch into enterprise procurement as options for corporate tooling.
- **Hardware risk accelerates attack yield.** Cheap physical exploits and supply-chain issues mean infrastructure with edge devices (kiosks, ATMs, IoT) will be targeted more often. Expect insurance claims and compliance scrutiny to follow.
- **New compliance expectations.** User-first data control tooling (export/erase) will make data portability a delivered feature, and regulators will treat it like a standard expectation rather than a novelty.
- **Talent market changes.** HOPE continues to be a place where practical, curious engineers are visible; companies that participate (sponsor, send folks) will find higher-signal hires for security, firmware, and infrastructure roles.

### TL;DR Action Items

Implications for CTOs: AI-driven automation is transforming enterprise workflows, from cybersecurity to customer service. CTOs must prioritize integrating agentic AI systems that balance autonomy with security. For example, implementing decentralized identity protocols can enhance user trust in AI interactions, while robust monitoring ensures agents don’t deviate from intended behaviors. Planning should include investing in AI governance frameworks to mitigate risks like data breaches or unintended escalations, as highlighted in recent AI cybersecurity discussions at conferences like DEF CON.

Deploy zero-trust, continuous pen-testing (XBOW-style), and encrypted IoT with OTA updates. Pair analytics with encryption to spot threats hiding in “secure” channels. 

Here’s what you should put on the sprint board and in the Q4 budget.

- **Treat agentic AI as a first-class threat and tool**
    - Pilot AI-assisted red-teaming and incorporate its findings into CI. Do not accept “AI found it” as a final decision — require human validation and safety gates.
    - Add LLM-specific adversarial tests to your SRE test matrix (reasoning fuzzing, chained-prompt stress tests).
- **Privacy-by-design is no longer optional**
    - Run an SDK/tags inventory immediately. Block or isolate anything that collects persistent identifiers or precise location data without clear business need.
    - Start at least one privacy pilot (e.g., internal mixnet VPN for high-risk teams or a no-tracking analytics stack for product telemetry).
- **Harden the physical edge**
    - Require firmware signing, secure boot, and remote revocation for any hardware you deploy. Treat field devices as a first-class threat vector.
    - Add a physical-access scenario to incident playbooks (someone with a debug cable, someone swapping SD cards, etc.).
- **Operationalize continuous pentesting**
    - Make continuous pentesting and config-drift scanning a mandatory pipeline stage for releases. Automate rollback criteria for dangerous changes.
    - Start contracting ethical hacker engagements specifically for IoT and physical systems.
- **Build relationships with hacker/hackathon communities**
    - Sponsor a village or send engineers who will return with actual sprint items. Pragmatic exposure beats second-hand slideware.
- **Supply-chain contingency**
    - For any hardware project, require BOM transparency from vendors and define alternative suppliers in contracts (and test them).

### Bottom Line

HOPE_16 wasn’t just cyber nostalgia given a new cadence. It was a reminder that the bleeding edge of hacker culture is shipping and will land in production if you don’t make it  there first. The good news: most of the defenses are practical and affordable. The bad news: ignoring them is an explicit invitation to any 16 year old script-kiddie with a spare weekend and a cheap SDR.
