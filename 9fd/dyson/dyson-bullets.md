- GPT-5 Dyson Bubble
    - Are we in an AI Bubble?
        - predicted OpenAI will need to spend trillions on data centers to scale ChatGPT.
        - Even Sam said there “could be” an AI bubble (on 8/18)
        - Bindu making the claim AI HAS BECOME TOO BIG TO FAIL
            - “Mag 7” is 35% of the S&P 500!
            - Any hit on these AI stocks will be a fatal blow to the stock market
    - OAI employees now selling more than $10B worth of stock to investors at $500B valuation (freeing up the shares to allow them to raise more money)
        - Cursos execs appearing on Livestream making GPT default over Claude’’
    - Bubble rumors were fueled by OpenAI’s near disastrous release of GPT-5, mainly due to their own overhyping of expectations, but also plagued by the new routing system’s disastrous performance, kneecapping plus, a lack of transparency about model serving, a backlash against the deactivation of previous (more sycophantic) versions, the lackluster performance of GPT-5 itself, and the egregious chart crimes and overall disconnected funereal tone of the release video. But nobody’s perfect right?
    - That being said, once again the lede was buried (as it was in April when their stunning perfection of text in images & videos was completely overshadowed by the Studio Ghibli craze and the ensuing IP brouhaha. This time it was product lead’s Kevin Weil’s turn to shine for releasing a version that managed to save their customers literally millions of dollars, why cutting their own costs on the supply side. In a fairer universe this would be seen a a career milestone for Weil (or any other CPO, tbf) but Sama managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, face planting the tonally dead and factually sus launch event. But let’s be clear, what Kevin has done here is a tremendous vindication of the faith placed in him when he was brought onboard, not that it wasn’t a full team effort. (Another OpenAI win you didn’t hear about: Stargate Norway announced as first data center in that program.)
        - Only GPT5 avail in Pro with no warning (and no user research) killed 4o before bringing it back
        - Altman said GPT-5’s [launch was botched](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/sam-altman-openai-chatgpt5-launch-data-centers-investments/) after backlash over the model’s colder persona forced OpenAI to reinstate GPT-4o for users.
        - “hyped like [it was] the second coming of Ultron” they were promised fireworks and got a desk lamp
        - Better but doesn’t feel like next scale in model size and certainly didn’t live up to the manhattan project / death star hype. As one CTO commented, “more like the size of his ego”
        - they ended up doubling the limit for GPT-5 Thinking and bringing back GPT-4o
    - Mean their CEO was tilting at more windmills, musing publically about buying Chrome (aftter Perplexity had already made the same startling claim for themselves), putting data centers on the moon ,and responding to concerns about covering the Earth with data centers by stating that we will simply build a Dyson sphere around the entire solar system (no, we’re not making that up) revealing not just an incredible confusion between of Type I and Type II civilizations on the Kardashev scale, but a fundamental lunacy about what a Dyson sphere actually is. Call it a Dyson Bubble.
    - nine minutes of mutual backslapping won’t hide the lack of vision.
    - Fudge Factory
        - OpenAI [claimed](https://x.com/deedydas/status/1953853659848016138) 74.9% on SWE-Bench just to prove they were above Opus 4.1’s 74.5%… By running it on 477 problems instead of the full 500.
        - Caught in the launch webcast presenting misleading data “chart crimes”
        - On top of Sama’s reputation rightly or wrongly for having a problem with honesty.
    - So what’s the deal here?
        - those of us old enough to remember their rumor that they couldn't do the 2023.release on time because it was too dangerous and they feared it would take over the world?)
        - reliance on *belief in the mission* over *clear monetization strategy*
        - OpenAI, like Apple, is now a consumer product company, so they have transitioned to proritizing normies over techies.
        - “trust us, it’ll be cool” is what passes for company vision these days
        - massive cash burn, unclear fundamentals
        - personality cult
            - tryna find a sticky narrative
        - But that gross misunderstanding of what a Dyson sphere raises uncomfortable questions about what else he grossly misunderstands and is thus making wild claims about that have no real basis in reality.
        - Apparently AI is in a bubble: a *Dyson Bubble.*
    - **ROI Calculator**: GPT-5 Cost Savings
        - [There's a strong case that GPT-5 could shift a large share of the $1.4B code-assistant spend from Anthropic to OpenAI during the next contract cycle.](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1953937572687647171)
