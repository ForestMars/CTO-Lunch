- And yet, no one is telling this story.
    
    Meanwhile, GPT-5 remained Pro-only at launch without warning, forcing OpenAI to reinstate GPT-4o after a backlash over GPT-5’s colder persona. Limits were doubled for GPT-5 Thinking, but the hype — promised as the Manhattan Project of AI or a “death star” moment — landed somewhere closer to the size of Altman’s ego, as one CTO put it.
    
    While the public was focused on the drama, the real story was a quiet triumph of product over personality. Amid the chaos, OpenAI's product lead, Kevin Weil, delivered a version of the model that managed to save customers millions of dollars while simultaneously cutting OpenAI's own supply-side costs. In a fairer world, this would be hailed as a career milestone for any CPO. Instead, this tremendous vindication of the faith placed in Weil and his team was completely overshadowed by the tonal and factual missteps of the launch event.
    
    Instead, this tremendous vindication was completely overshadowed by tonal missteps and corporate theater. It's becoming a pattern: in April, the team's stunning perfection of text in images and videos was overshadowed by IP controversies. Major wins like the announcement of Stargate Norway, OpenAI's first global data center, barely made headlines.
    
    - This time it was product lead’s Kevin Weil’s turn to shine for releasing a version that managed to save their customers literally millions of dollars, why cutting their own costs on the supply side. In a fairer universe this would be seen a a career milestone for Weil (or any other CPO, tbf) but Sama managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, face planting the tonally dead and factually sus launch event. But let’s be clear, what Kevin has done here is a tremendous vindication of the faith placed in him when he was brought onboard, not that it wasn’t a full team effort. (Another OpenAI win you didn’t hear about: Stargate Norway announced as first data center in that program.)
