## Web3

- L1‚Äôs, Stablecoins and Real World Adoption
    - US treasury will no longer request user data from decentralizaed crypto apps
    - Google has announced their L1 blockchain.
    - [Stripe launches L1](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45129085)
    - [**MetaMask**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamask/)ü¶äannounced mUSD, the wallet's native stablecoin.
    - (both announcements met in Web3 with a collective shrug, as if to say, Token or GTFO.)
    - stablecoins - https://slashdot.org/story/25/08/26/2338207/citi-executive-warns-stablecoin-yields-could-drain-bank-deposits
    - a lot of real-world businesses finding utility in stablecoins. For example, Bridge (a stablecoin orchestration platform that Stripe acquired) is used by SpaceX for managing money in long-tail markets. Another big customer, DolarApp, is providing banking services to customers in Latin America. We're currently adding stablecoin functionality to the Stripe dashboard, and the first user is an Argentinian bike importer that finds transacting with their suppliers to be challenging.
    - Who knew stablecoins would be the killer app?
    - Today, if you want to transact between businesses or retail (folks like you and I), you need to find a route between the two entities' banks. This route might take several hops, passing through some central banks, and some of these hops might be instant or might take days to actually settle. On top of that, you need to pay the service that helped you find a route (SWIFT) and potentially the nodes your transaction goes through. Bottomline, it can be slow and a lot of middle men are taxing you.
