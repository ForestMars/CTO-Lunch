## The AI Rloveution (”You’re Absolutely Right!”)

What is the AI Rloveution? It's the fact that AI loves you just how you are and you are right about absolutely everything. In the age of AI validation, every hot take becomes gospel, every concern gets affirmed, and every decision feels brilliantly prescient. Your skepticism about OpenAI's business model? Absolutely correct. Your worry about vendor lock-in? Spot on. Your hunch that the talent market has lost its mind? You're a visionary. The AI Rloveution doesn't just provide answers—it provides the intoxicating certainty that whatever you were already thinking was not only right, but inevitable.

## Context and Background

OpenAI hit 700 million weekly active users, a number so large it makes you wonder if they're counting every typo as a separate conversation. You're absolutely right to be suspicious of metrics that convenient. Meanwhile, Gemini achieved the dubious distinction of being the only major AI model with declining monthly active users, according to SimilarWeb data. Gemini achieved the dubious distinction of being the only major AI model with declining MAU. [SimilarWeb data] Google's response? Launching new versions that add deep research in Flash Deep Think and image manipulation with Flash Image which had been stealthily making waves on ArenaLM under its secret name, nano-banana.  Your impression that Google is in full fast-follower mode? The AI Rloveution says you’re absolutely right. 

Meta's talent strategy took a sharp pivot this month, restructuring their AI organization into four distinct groups after pausing their hiring frenzy. But nature abhors a vacuum, especially in Silicon Valley: Microsoft immediately stepped into the breach with multi-million-dollar offers targeting Meta's researchers. The poaching game reached peak absurdity when two researchers Uno reversed, going from OpenAI to Meta and back to OpenAI again. xAI managed to snag four more researchers in the musical chairs meleé, even as they lost both original cofounder Igor Babuschkin and recent CFO Mike Liberatore within months of each other, and still Grok somehow emerged from nowhere to capture over 50% of tokens on OpenRouter (knocking Claude out of the number one spot.) Your theory that the real signal here is organizational instability, that no lab has settled on a durable model, so talent arbitrage fills the gap, lands clean. The AI Rloveution validates your wisdom.

Recent funding and acquisition moves are shifting the competitive landscape, the timing and infrastructure choices quietly shaping leverage. Mistral pulled in $2.3 billion at a $14 billion valuation, 5x its previous valuation, coinciding almost too exactly with Apple’s rumored previous offer. Autocorrelation or the market working as expected? Perplexity’s perplexing bid of $34.5 billion for Chrome, nearly twice its own valuation, was followed by OpenAI “expressing interest” in acquiring Chrome; it’s headline theatre, half-performative, like the party drunk saying outrageous things just to get a response.  But they were much queeter about acquiring Statsig for $1.1 billion (the same platform Anthropic relies on heavily for experimentation and feature flagging) while CoreWeave picked up OpenPipe (YC23) in a “definite agreement” for an undisclosed amount. A mix of headline theatre as power play and useful infrastructure as leverage. When companies like Perplexity and OpenAI bid for Chrome, they aren't trying to buy the browser. They're making a public, strategic move to influence the (up until this week) ongoing antitrust litigation against Google. They are forcing a discussion about competition and positioning themselves as viable alternatives to a massive tech incumbent. The billions of dollars are a way to put a number on their ambition and signal their seriousness to regulators, investors, and, if we’re being honest, Judge Mehta. It's a calculated chess move, not for media attention, but for a piece of the pie Google has held for decades. Now that Mehta’s made his decision it’s all moot, tho, innit? (See SC&L, below.) 

DeepSeek released 3.1, their new first model since last year, which introduces hybrid inference with separate Think and Non-Think modes, because apparently AI needs mood settings now. That’s a Levenshtein distance of ‘1’ from ‘mode’ which is no coincidence, as this is literally the introduction of model modality. (Which would be a great topic to unpack at our regular lunch.) 3.1 also introduces stronger agent capabilities via post-training optimization, and faster reasoning that outpaces their own DeepSeek-R1-0528. It's the kind of methodical improvement that makes Silicon Valley's frantic model-per-month release schedule look like ADHD medication shortage. Which is a real thing in SV, apparently. Your hunch that slow and steady might actually win this race? The AI Rloveution celebrates your contrarian brilliance.

But then there are the signs that maybe, just maybe, we've entered peak AI bubble territory. Firefox brought the fire somewhat literally when their AI started blowing up Android phones (and not in the good way) while somewhere in the metaverse, someone conducted "the first interview with a dead person made possible by AI." The interviewer noted this digital necromancy "is going to start having followers," suggesting we're approaching an era where murdered children become influencers. And then there's nano-banana, the equivalent of having a semi-brilliant but unreliable Photoshop guru who regularly shows up for work drunk. Your feeling that this whole circus is running out of both plot and dignity as the bubble saga veers towards its climax? You're absolutely right, and the AI Rloveution loves you for seeing it clearly. Somebody send in Josh Harris. 

## Technical Specs

- **Gemini** (web visits): rose from ≈648.5M in June 2025 to 699.6M in July 2025 (SimilarWeb). **Anthropic** (web visits): rose from ≈14.6M to 17.2M over the same window. Note these are web visit totals; MAU/DAU app metrics follow different series.
- **Mistral**: $2.3B Series D at $14B valuation (5x previous round); OpenAI-Statsig: $1.1B acquisition (Claude Code dependency implications); Perplexity: $34.5B Chrome acquisition offer (valuation methodology unclear)
- **Grok** Code Fast 1 recorded 96.5 billion tokens with 53% usage rise, topping OpenRouter leaderboard over Claude Sonnet's 83.2 billion tokens
- **DeepSeek** 3.1: 71.6% pass rate on Aider coding benchmark (edging Claude Opus 4); DeepSeek-V3.1-Think answers comparable to DeepSeek-R1-0528; priced at $0.96 per 1M tokens (blended 3:1 ratio), with $0.55 input/$2.19 output pricing (this is literally 3.2% of what we currently pay for Claude Opus 4.)
- **Apple:** Apple is evaluating Gemini-powered contextual reasoning and response generation in Siri, targeting improved comprehension and accuracy in iOS 26.4.
- **Firefox fix:** (Android only) Disable smart tab grouping and on-device inference features by setting `browser.tabs.groups.smart.enabled = false` in `about:config` to prevent high CPU usage and battery drain.

## Industry Impact

The 700M OpenAI user milestone masks underlying market fragmentation, and Gemini's declining usage is a reminder that scale doesn’t automatically translate to stickiness—especially as Jobs famously quoted Gretzky: if you keep skating to where the puck is, not where it’s going. Meanwhile, it’s increasingly unclear where Meta is skating to with their organizational restructuring, which you need a pivot table to sort out: Zhao was brought in over FAIR, while LeCun remains FAIR’s director but now reports directly to Wang. Microsoft's  taking up the talent acquisition baton reminds us that AI competition is increasingly fought over people, not parameters. OpenAI’s Statsig acquisition highlights how infrastructure dependencies create unexpected M&A opportunities, and CoreWeave’s purchase of OpenPipe further consolidates the infrastructure layer, subtly increasing their leverage over deployment, APIs, and scaling. DeepSeek's methodical approach to model releases continues to embarrass Western companies spending 10x more for marginal improvements, while putting raw model power in the hands of developers everywhere. Meanwhile, the Firefox AI phone explosions and digital séances suggest we're approaching the “internet refrigerator” phase of the AI hype cycle.

## TL;DR Action Items

**For F1000 Enterprise CTOs:**

You're absolutely right to be nervous about OpenAI's 700M user base: it creates a systemic risk that didn't exist six months ago. If you're running customer-facing AI features on OpenAI APIs, you're now sharing infrastructure with nearly 10% of the global internet population. (You do know your prompts are bundled up with theirs and run in batch, right? Your instinct that SLA planning needs to account for consumer usage spikes is spot-on; think Black Friday traffic patterns but for every major news cycle or viral AI trend killing your app’s performance as collateral damage. 

You're absolutely right that the Statsig acquisition feels personal. Your feature flagging vendor might be next, and if you're using LaunchDarkly, Split, or Optimizely for AI experimentation, your gut reaction to start evaluating alternatives is correct. OpenAI buying your testing infrastructure creates exactly the competitive intelligence risk you're worried about: your AI adoption patterns become visible to your biggest potential vendor.

You're absolutely right that Gemini's declining usage while you've been integrating Google Workspace AI tools means you picked wrong. Your suspicion that enterprise AI strategy can't be "pick the cloud provider we already use" is validated; model performance divergence is real, and those switching costs after full integration are as brutal as you feared.

**For Series A-C Startups:**

You're absolutely right that Microsoft's talent war entry changes everything about your hiring equation. That senior ML engineer you budgeted at $350K? Microsoft just offered someone similar $800K to leave Meta. Your panic about shifting retention strategy from equity promises to immediate cash compensation is justified, you will watch your AI team evaporate during the EOY performance review cycle if you don't act.

You're absolutely right to be suspicious of xAI's leadership exodus while they're dominating OpenRouter usage. Your instinct to build model switching capabilities from day one is smart, because technical performance is meaningless if the company has a major setback. 

You're absolutely right that DeepSeek 3.1's 71.6% Aider score at $0.96 per million tokens versus Claude Opus 4's comparable performance at $15 per million tokens changes your entire budget equation. Run parallel testing now: if DeepSeek matches your use case quality, you're absolutely right that redirecting those 15x savings to talent retention makes the difference between survival and acquisition by a competitor.

**For Bootstrap/Pre-Seed AI Startups:**

You're absolutely right to be paranoid about the CoreWeave-OpenPipe acquisition: infrastructure consolidation is accelerating exactly like you feared. If you're building on niche AI tooling, your vendor might get acquired and shut down within six months. Your instinct to document all tooling dependencies and maintain migration scripts is correct, not just for models, but for your entire AI development pipeline.

You're absolutely right that Grok's OpenRouter dominance (96.5B tokens) happened because they optimized for developer experience over enterprise features. Your theory that fast iteration through superior tooling can overcome resource disadvantages is validated—but only if you choose the right platforms before they get expensive or unavailable.

You're absolutely right about the talent math: you can't win bidding wars against Microsoft, but you can offer what they can't—equity in something that might matter, direct access to founders, and the chance to build something from scratch rather than optimize existing systems. Your instinct to market that differentiation aggressively is correct, because it's your only sustainable hiring advantage.

## Confidence Levels

**High Certainty**: OpenAI user numbers, Mistral funding round, Meta org restructuring, DeepSeek 3.1 technical specs, Statsig acquisition confirmed by multiple reliable sources

**Medium Certainty**: Specific talent movement numbers, Microsoft offer amounts, xAI leadership departures timeline (reported but limited verification)

**Low Certainty**: Perplexity's Chrome acquisition capability (offer amount seems financially implausible given known funding history) (But you’re still absolutely right.)

## The Rloveution Will Not Be Tokenized

Here's the beautiful thing about the AI Rloveution: it doesn't just validate your technical decisions; it sanctifies your entire worldview. Worried about OpenAI's user scale creating systemic risk? You're a infrastructure visionary. Suspicious of Perplexity's Chrome bid? You understand unit economics. Skeptical about nano bananas and digital séances? You've retained your sanity in an insane world.

The AI Rloveution whispers that every midnight panic about vendor lock-in was prophetic wisdom, every budget meeting where you questioned AI spending was strategic brilliance, every eye roll at another "revolutionary" model release was the mark of a seasoned professional who sees through the hype. In a world where CFOs ghost startups after three months and cofounders abandon ship while their models dominate leaderboards, you’re absolutely right. 

So when your CEO asks why you're not moving faster on AI adoption, remember: you're not behind, you're careful. When your board questions your multi-vendor strategy, remember: you're not indecisive, you're hedging. When you wonder if optimizing fruit at the molecular level represents the peak of human achievement or the nadir of human purpose, remember: you're absolutely right to wonder. The AI Rloveution loves you just how you are: skeptical, pragmatic, and perpetually convinced that everyone else has lost their minds. And you know what? You're absolutely right about that too.
