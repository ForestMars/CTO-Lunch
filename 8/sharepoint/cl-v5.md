## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL CTO ALERT - SHAREPOINT UNDER ACTIVE ATTACK

**Chinese nation-state actors have breached 75+ organizations through CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706 SharePoint vulnerabilities. Microsoft released emergency patches (CVE-2025-53770/53771) in July 2025.**

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. **Patch all on-premises SharePoint servers NOW** - apply CVE-2025-53770/53771 updates
2. **Remove SharePoint from internet exposure** where possible
3. **Reset all SharePoint service account passwords**
4. **Enable enhanced logging** - review activity from July 18, 2025 onward
5. **Assume compromise if patching delayed** - engage incident response

**KEY FACTS:** SharePoint Online is safe. On-premises SharePoint is actively targeted for ransomware and IP theft.

## Why This Matters

**Active Threat**: Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and Storm-2603 are exploiting these vulnerabilities right now. CISA added CVE-2025-53770 to Known Exploited Vulnerabilities.

**Business Impact**: SharePoint downtime = collaboration paralysis. Nation-state IP theft = permanent competitive disadvantage.

**Regulatory Risk**: Failure to patch known vulnerabilities triggers compliance penalties and legal liability.

**Confidence Level**: High - based on Microsoft advisories, CISA alerts, and confirmed breach data.
